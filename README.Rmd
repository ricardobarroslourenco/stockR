# stockR

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of stockR is to provide a very basic toolkit for carbon modelers. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of stockR like so:

``` r
# Load devtools
library(devtools)

# Load stockR from github
install_github("ricardobarroslourenco/stockR")
```

## Examples

For examples, we recommend looking into the "vignettes" folder.

## Disclaimer
This is a very minimal package, and still on VERY early stage (also, part of a class project. More details [here](https://github.com/ricardobarroslourenco/My_First_Repository))
